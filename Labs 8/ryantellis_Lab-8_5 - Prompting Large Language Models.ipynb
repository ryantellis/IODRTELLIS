    "# Lab 8.5 - Prompting Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will practise prompting with a few Large Language Models (LLMs) using Groq (not to be confused with Grok). Groq is a platform that provides access to their custom-built AI hardware via APIs, allowing users to run open-source models such as Llama.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall see that while LLMs are powerful tools, how you ask a question or frame a task can dramatically influence the results obtained."

    "SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the San Francisco area Friday at 4:42 a.m. PT (7:42 a.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake left about 2,000 customers without power, said David Eisenhower, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Light. Under the USGS classification, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake is considered \"light,\" which it says usually causes minimal damage. \"We had quite a spike in calls, mostly calls of inquiry, none of any injury, none of any damage that was reported,\" said Capt. Al Casciato of the San Francisco police. \"It was fairly mild.\" Watch police describe concerned calls immediately after the quake » . The quake was centered about two miles east-northeast of Oakland, at a depth of 3.6 miles, the USGS said. Oakland is just east of San Francisco, across San Francisco Bay. An Oakland police dispatcher told CNN the quake set off alarms at people's homes. The shaking lasted about 50 seconds, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. According to the USGS, magnitude 4.2 quakes are felt indoors and may break dishes and windows and overturn unstable objects. Pendulum clocks may stop.\n",

       "The reaction between two chemicals can be complex and depends on various factors, such as the type of chemicals involved, the conditions under which they are brought together, and the energy available. Here's a general overview of how two chemicals react:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Collision Theory**: For a chemical reaction to occur, the molecules of the two substances must collide with each other. The collision must be energetic enough to break the bonds between the atoms in the molecules and form new bonds.\n",
       "2. **Activation Energy**: The energy required for the molecules to collide and react is called the activation energy. If the energy is too low, the molecules will simply bounce off each other, and no reaction will occur.\n",
       "3. **Chemical Reaction Types**: There are several types of chemical reactions, including:\n",
       "\t* **Synthesis reaction**: Two molecules combine to form a new molecule (e.g., H2 + O2 → H2O).\n",
       "\t* **Decomposition reaction**: A single molecule breaks down into two or more molecules (e.g., 2H2O → 2H2 + O2).\n",
       "\t* **Replacement reaction**: One molecule replaces another molecule in a compound (e.g., Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu).\n",
       "\t* **Combustion reaction**: A molecule reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light (e.g., CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O).\n",
       "4. **Reaction Mechanism**: The reaction mechanism is the sequence of steps that occurs during the reaction. It can be a single step or multiple steps, and it may involve the formation of intermediate molecules.\n",
       "5. **Factors Affecting Reaction Rate**: The rate of a chemical reaction can be influenced by various factors, including:\n",
       "\t* **Concentration**: Increasing the concentration of one or both reactants can increase the reaction rate.\n",
       "\t* **Temperature**: Increasing the temperature can increase the reaction rate, but it can also lead to unwanted side reactions.\n",
       "\t* **Catalysts**: Adding a catalyst can increase the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy.\n",
       "\t* **Surface area**: Increasing the surface area of one or both reactants can increase the reaction rate.\n",
       "\n",
       "To understand how two chemicals react, you need to know the chemical formulas and properties of the substances, as well as the conditions under which they are brought together. You can use various tools, such as:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Chemical equation**: A chemical equation is a shorthand way of representing a chemical reaction.\n",
       "* **Balanced equation**: A balanced equation is a chemical equation in which the number of atoms of each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides.\n",
       "* **Reaction diagram**: A reaction diagram is a graphical representation of a chemical reaction, showing the reactants, products, and intermediate molecules.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's an example of a simple chemical reaction:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Reaction:** H2 + O2 → H2O\n",
       "\n",
       "**Reactants:** Hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Products:** Water (H2O)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conditions:** The reaction occurs when the hydrogen and oxygen gases are brought together in the presence of a spark or heat.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Mechanism:** The reaction involves the collision of a hydrogen molecule with an oxygen molecule, resulting in the formation of a water molecule.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Factors affecting reaction rate:** The reaction rate can be affected by the concentration of the reactants, the temperature, and the presence of a catalyst.\n",
       "\n",
       "Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and the actual reaction mechanism may be more complex."

       "1. **Combination Reaction**: This is like mixing ingredients to create something new. For example, making a cake by combining flour, sugar, eggs, and milk.\n",
       "2. **Decomposition Reaction**: This is like breaking down ingredients to create something simpler. For example, when you leave food out and it spoils, breaking down into simpler compounds.\n",
       "3. **Single Element Reaction**: This is like combining two elements, like hydrogen and oxygen (H2 + O2) to create water (H2O).\n",
       "4. **Displacement Reaction**: This is like replacing one element with another. For example, when iron (Fe) is added to copper oxide, it replaces the copper (Cu) to form iron oxide (Fe2O3).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Factors That Influence Reactions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Temperature**: Heat can speed up or slow down reactions. Think of a cake recipe that requires baking at 350°F.\n",
       "2. **Pressure**: Applying pressure can affect the rate of a reaction. Imagine squeezing a bottle of soda to create more pressure.\n",
       "3. **Light**: Some reactions require light energy, like photosynthesis in plants.\n",
       "4. **Catalysts**: These are substances that help speed up reactions without being used up. Think of a chef's favorite spice that enhances flavor.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Remember:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Chemical reactions involve changes in the arrangement of particles, creating new substances.\n",

       "      <td>Bartholomew \"Barry\" Butterfield III, a chubby, cherub-faced baby with a shock of unruly ginger hair, stared intently at the magnificent, towering structure that was his mother's favorite houseplant. It was a fern, a leafy green behemoth that reached almost to the coffee table, its fronds unfurling like emerald flags in the afternoon sun. \\n\\nBarry coveted the fern.  Not for its exotic greenery, but for its precarious position atop a wobbly toy box. Every morning, his mother would perch the box on the rug, tempting him with the forbidden land of soft-plush toys and crinkly treat bags. And  just beyond that tempting space, the fern. It felt like a magical kingdom just out of reach. \\n\\nFor weeks, Barry had practiced pushing and scooting himself with his chubby arms. He'd propel himself backward, forwards, and sometimes even sideways, but never onward to the glorious fern. He'd watch his older sister, Penelope, glide across the room with the ease of a newborn gazelle, and scoff.  Crawling was for show! He would conquer it on his own terms, in a feat of unparalleled baby brilliance. \\n\\nOne sunny morning, a determined glint ignited in Barry's baby blue eyes. He positioned himself, feet planted firmly, then, with a grunt and a wiggle, thrust his arms forward. His face scrunched in concentration, his bottom lifting and lowering like a mini marshmallow on a hot pan. \\n\\nHe moved!  It was a jerky, stuttering dance, his arms flailing wildly, his legs splaying like a confused spider. But he was moving! He was creeping towards his coveted target!\\n\\nHis mother, who had been diligently working on a cross-stitch project, watched in amusement. \\n\\n“That’s it, Barry! You’re doing it!” \\n\\nHer cheery encouragement only fueled Barry’s determination. He forgot his wobbly gait, his awkward limbs, and his mother's increasingly bewildered narration of his journey.  He was on a mission! His tiny brow furrowed, his tongue poked out in concentration.\\n\\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity (to Barry, at least), he reached the toy box. His chest heaved, his tiny heart pounded with triumph. He had conquered the first obstacle!\\n\\nBut the fern still loomed, a verdant promise just beyond. With renewed vigor, Barry pulled himself toward the leafy giant, his legs churning, his arms reaching, his face a mask of sweaty, triumphant determination.\\n\\nAt last, he reached the fern’s base. He leaned forward, his chubby hand reaching out to touch the delicate fronds. He had done it! He had climbed Mount Fern! \\n\\nBarry’s mother, tears welling up in her eyes, scooped him into her arms.\\n\\n\"My brave little explorer!\" she exclaimed.\\n\\nBarry, exhausted but proud, gurgled happily, nibbling at his mother’s cheek.  The world felt full of adventures, and there were so many more ferns to conquer.</td>\n",

Now, subtract 44 from 88 to get 44, which is half of 22 * 13.\\n44 * 2 = 88 (quickly calculate)\\n88 - 44 = 44\\n\\n**Method 4: Using a multiplication table**\\nIf you have a multiplication table memorized, you can quickly look up the result: 22 * 13 = 286.\\n\\nThese are just a few methods to calculate 22 * 13 mentally.

She had been watching the world go by through her big, curious eyes for a while now, and she was determined to be a part of it. Or at least, to get to the toys that were just out of reach.\\n\\nLily's arms and legs squirmed and kicked, trying to propel herself towards the nearest toy, a bright red ball that rolled away whenever she tried to grab it. Her chubby little hands waved in the air, as if trying to catch a bird in flight.\\n\\nJust then, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves of a nearby plant, causing the plant to sway slightly. Lily's eyes followed the motion, and suddenly, an idea popped into her head. Why not try to move her body in the same way? She pushed off with her legs, and to her surprise, she started to inch forward, her arms wiggling back and forth like a little worm.\\n\\nEureka! Lily had crawled! Well, probably not in the classical sense, but she had definitely moved her body in a way that brought her closer to that tantalizing red ball. And wasn't that what mattered?\\n\\nAs the days went by, Lily grew more confident in her newfound skill. She would crawl, stop, and then reverse direction, using her arms to steer herself like a little tugboat. Her parents cheered and clapped whenever she made progress, and soon she was zooming across the floor, her little legs pumping furiously.\\n\\nOne day, Lily spotted a particularly enticing toy just out of reach. She fixed her eyes on it, took a deep breath, and launched herself in the direction of her heart's desire. This time, she didn't just inch forward – she crawled, fast and furious, her whole body moving like a machine.\\n\\nAnd then, in a flash of triumph, her little hand closed around the toy, and she beamed with pride. \"I did it!\" she squealed, holding the toy aloft like a trophy.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Lily was unstoppable. She crawled through tunnel after tunnel, over pillows and under blankets, her giggles echoing through the air. And her parents, watching with pride, knew that this little ball of energy was going to grow up to be a brave adventurer, always reaching for the next great challenge.\\n\\nThe end.</td>\n",

       "2  Bartholomew \"Barry\" Butterfield III, a chubby, cherub-faced baby with a shock of unruly ginger hair, stared intently at the magnificent, towering structure that was his mother's favorite houseplant. It was a fern, a leafy green behemoth that reached almost to the coffee table, its fronds unfurling like emerald flags in the afternoon sun. \\n\\nBarry coveted the fern.  Not for its exotic greenery, but for its precarious position atop a wobbly toy box. Every morning, his mother would perch the box on the rug, tempting him with the forbidden land of soft-plush toys and crinkly treat bags. And  just beyond that tempting space, the fern. It felt like a magical kingdom just out of reach. \\n\\nFor weeks, Barry had practiced pushing and scooting himself with his chubby arms. He'd propel himself backward, forwards, and sometimes even sideways, but never onward to the glorious fern. He'd watch his older sister, Penelope, glide across the room with the ease of a newborn gazelle, and scoff.  Crawling was for show! He would conquer it on his own terms, in a feat of unparalleled baby brilliance. \\n\\nOne sunny morning, a determined glint ignited in Barry's baby blue eyes. He positioned himself, feet planted firmly, then, with a grunt and a wiggle, thrust his arms forward. His face scrunched in concentration, his bottom lifting and lowering like a mini marshmallow on a hot pan. \\n\\nHe moved!  It was a jerky, stuttering dance, his arms flailing wildly, his legs splaying like a confused spider. But he was moving! He was creeping towards his coveted target!\\n\\nHis mother, who had been diligently working on a cross-stitch project, watched in amusement. \\n\\n“That’s it, Barry! You’re doing it!” \\n\\nHer cheery encouragement only fueled Barry’s determination. He forgot his wobbly gait, his awkward limbs, and his mother's increasingly bewildered narration of his journey.  He was on a mission! His tiny brow furrowed, his tongue poked out in concentration.\\n\\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity (to Barry, at least), he reached the toy box. His chest heaved, his tiny heart pounded with triumph. He had conquered the first obstacle!\\n\\nBut the fern still loomed, a verdant promise just beyond. With renewed vigor, Barry pulled himself toward the leafy giant, his legs churning, his arms reaching, his face a mask of sweaty, triumphant determination.\\n\\nAt last, he reached the fern’s base. He leaned forward, his chubby hand reaching out to touch the delicate fronds. He had done it!

Then add the results:\\n20 * 13 = 260 (quickly multiply 20 by 10 = 200, then add 3 x 20 = 60)\\n2 * 13 = 26\\nAdd both results: 260 + 26 = 286\\n\\n**Method 2: Using multiplication facts**\\nUse your multiplication facts to calculate:\\n22 * 10 = 220 (common fact)\\n220 * 1 = 220 (since 13 is 10 + 3, you can use this fact)\\nAdd 2 * 13 = 26 (quickly multiply 2 by 13: 2 x 10 = 20, then add 3 x 2 = 6)\\nAdd both results: 220 + 26 = 246 (no, wait, 286!)\\n\\n**Method 3: Using doubling and doubling**\\nDouble 22 to get 44, then double it again to get 88. Now, subtract 44 from 88 to get 44, which is half of 22 * 13.\\n44 * 2 = 88 (quickly calculate)\\n88 - 44 = 44\\n\\n**Method 4: Using a multiplication table**\\nIf you have a multiplication table memorized, you can quickly look up the result: 22 * 13 = 286.\\n\\nThese are just a few methods to calculate 22 * 13 mentally. Practice makes perfect, so try out different methods to see which one works best for you!  \n",

She had been watching the world go by through her big, curious eyes for a while now, and she was determined to be a part of it. Or at least, to get to the toys that were just out of reach.\\n\\nLily's arms and legs squirmed and kicked, trying to propel herself towards the nearest toy, a bright red ball that rolled away whenever she tried to grab it. Her chubby little hands waved in the air, as if trying to catch a bird in flight.\\n\\nJust then, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves of a nearby plant, causing the plant to sway slightly. Lily's eyes followed the motion, and suddenly, an idea popped into her head. Why not try to move her body in the same way? She pushed off with her legs, and to her surprise, she started to inch forward, her arms wiggling back and forth like a little worm.\\n\\nEureka! Lily had crawled! Well, probably not in the classical sense, but she had definitely moved her body in a way that brought her closer to that tantalizing red ball. And wasn't that what mattered?\\n\\nAs the days went by, Lily grew more confident in her newfound skill. She would crawl, stop, and then reverse direction, using her arms to steer herself like a little tugboat. Her parents cheered and clapped whenever she made progress, and soon she was zooming across the floor, her little legs pumping furiously.\\n\\nOne day, Lily spotted a particularly enticing toy just out of reach. She fixed her eyes on it, took a deep breath, and launched herself in the direction of her heart's desire. This time, she didn't just inch forward – she crawled, fast and furious, her whole body moving like a machine.\\n\\nAnd then, in a flash of triumph, her little hand closed around the toy, and she beamed with pride. \"I did it!\" she squealed, holding the toy aloft like a trophy.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Lily was unstoppable. She crawled through tunnel after tunnel, over pillows and under blankets, her giggles echoing through the air. And her parents, watching with pride, knew that this little ball of energy was going to grow up to be a brave adventurer, always reaching for the next great challenge.\\n\\nThe end.  "
